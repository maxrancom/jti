                    Many investors that manage their investment portfolio
                    through the bank are unaware of the high costs involved in
                    this type of management.

                    If you manage an investment portfolio through one of the
                    banks it is likely to assume that you are paying hundreds,
                    and sometime even thousands of NIS annually and we ask, why?
                    Not to mention that the return is also not always
                    commensurate/proportional. If you have money for investment

                    The automated trading systems manage all trading
                    transactions completely independently. They check and
                    monitor themselves at every given time, respond quickly to
                    every change in decision variables and can close
                    transactions and change the portfolio structure if needed.
                    They time entry and exit points into and from transactions,
                    execute and manage transactions in real-time and check
                    themselves based on a range of parameters, among them:
                    behavior patterns, daily cycles, changes in price levels,

                    The computerized systems can change trade strategy
                    parameters in real-time, according to market developments
                    and changes in decision variables. Risk and monetary balance
                    management in the client&rsquo;s portfolio is conducted
                    automatically according to the portfolio value and all open
                    transactions according to the client&rsquo;s preferences and
                    requests. At any given moment it is possible to change
